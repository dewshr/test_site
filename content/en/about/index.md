This blog is a personal blog for note taking of things I learn and keeping track of things. This blog is mainly focussed in the field of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology.

The posts will mainly contain codes related to python and some R programming. It will also include some statistical concepts and recent papers published in the field. All other things that doesn't fall with in these categories will be added to 'Other_stuffs'.
